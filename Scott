        <br><p>We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.<br>
            
           
            <br>Talent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're willing 
            to practice, you can do.<br>
         
            <br>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.<br>
          
            <br>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals.<br> 
            That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.<br>
            
            <br>Let's get crazy.<br>

            <br>There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.<br>
          
            <br>The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it.<br>
            Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do.<br> 
            Anything. As long as you believe.<br>
            
            <br>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction,<br>
            and a vision in your mind.<br>
         
            <br>wash the brush, just beats the devil out of it<br></p>
